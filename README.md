React - ele = createElement
ReactDOM - createRoot ,root.render(ele)

Separation of concerns

async vs defer - async download and run immediately
defer - download and run after html parsing is completed

React element is nothing but JS objects

render understands the ele, which is an JS object and constructs html element from it
